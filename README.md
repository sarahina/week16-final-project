# week15-crud-using-api

    • Using the Houses API, or any open API of your choice you can find online, 
    create a single page that allows for all 4 CRUD operations to be performed on a resource from the API. 
    • Create a React component (or more, if needed) to represent the resource. 
    • Make all forms and other necessary UI pieces their own components as reasonable.
